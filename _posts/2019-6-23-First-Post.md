Here we go.

I did my first 2 hours of freeCodeCamp this summer and it's just the beginning. 

My plan is to actually try to explain something that I learned the past week but not going to do that today since I put in too little time. I went through a few exercises on Data Structures. All was pretty basic and I mostly had trouble with the syntax since I haven't coded for a while. I will have more to write about in the next post.

I will see you then.
