title: City vs. Countryside
---

I was traveling quite a bit this week and saw very different places; large cities, small towns and woods. Since I was switching between these environments quickly I noticed the differences much more clearly.

Strange things happens when you have a lot of people in the same place. When walking on a busy street you will generally not greet anyone unless you know them, but meeting someone in the woods and not acknowledging the other person would be weird. It makes sense that you can not greet everyone on a busy street, so it becomes unnatural to single some people out. If you do that you need to have a reason for making contact other than simply saying hello.

Paradoxically does higher population at a certain point not increase how much we socialize because the interaction become less valued. <em>"I can easily find someone that fits me like a glove because statistically there are so many more people to meet."</em> Just because numbers tell you that there is more fish in the sea, does not mean that you necessarily should fish indefinitely. You also need to bring that fish home and cook it into a delicious meal.

A large criteria for making a friend is time spent together. If you lived your whole life in a small town you would probably have more close friendships but maybe not with people that fit you like a glove. So I think you want a balance where you have big enough population that you never run out of new people to meet and possibly "glove" but at the same time be local enough that you can over time build these other kind of friendships that are more based on time spent together.

My conclusion from this very sporadic post is that I find middle-sized cities that offer everything that a large city offers but not in excess best, because you might strike the balance that you get most of the benefits from a large city while avoiding some of the negatives.

As an aside: I am just writing what comes to me in the moment. I am not making any factual claims, but please hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jespancer) to disagree.
