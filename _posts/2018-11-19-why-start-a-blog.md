title: Why start a blog?
---

I have a need to communicate myself because I am genuinely curious about life. Through discourse with sensible individuals I can get closer to that fleeting reality of it all. Blogging is one of many ways to communicate through the written word and a format that I think suits my personality very well. I can through a longer format of a blog post express whatever is on my mind without restricting my character limit.

There is definitely a place for short form writing as well and that is why I am also on various social media platforms, like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Jespancer).

My schedule is one blog post every Sunday. I want to make it a weekly routine to sit down on a calm Sunday morning and flesh out my thoughts in this format.

I hope that these posts will bring some value to other people but the real reason for my blog posts is for me to try and get closer to the truth.
